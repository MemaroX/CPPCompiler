This project is a simple lexical analyzer (or lexer) implemented in Python.
It scans a sample of code to identify various token types like keywords, operators, identifiers, comments, numeric constants, and special characters, making it easier to analyze and interpret the structure of the code.
Code Input: Accepts code entered line-by-line.
Token Display: Outputs recognized tokens after input ends (WRITE 'get_tokens' after you enter your whole code)
